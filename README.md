- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dyrias or can call me just dy (because it's pretty cool)
- 👀 I’m interested in development of softwares and projecting of hardwares.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++, and so far liking it but still so bored to testing things.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some free source code projects also to gain some experience
(thought i dont know very well how to begin)
- 📫 Just send a mensage here, or on discord (@dyrias if you have something  to ask me
(not that i know why tho).
